# Logistic Regression with Iris Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **Logistic Regression** using the famous Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. The goal is to classify the iris species—**Setosa**, **Versicolour**, and **Virginica**—based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of:
- **150 samples** of iris flowers.
- **4 features**: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **3 classes**: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica.

The dataset is available in the Scikit-Learn library, making it easy to load and use.

## Objectives

1. Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
2. Train a logistic regression model for multi-class classification.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
4. Visualize the decision boundaries and performance metrics.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Features

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Loading the Iris dataset from Scikit-Learn.
   - Analyzing the dataset structure and statistical properties.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Training a logistic regression model on the dataset.
   - Tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Generating classification metrics.
   - Plotting confusion matrices and decision boundaries.

## Results

- Achieved high classification accuracy on the Iris dataset.
- Visualizations demonstrate clear separability between species.
